# My Groceries UI/UX Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for My Groceries's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### 1.1. Overall UX Goals & Principles

##### Target User Personas
*   **The Data-Driven Home Cook:** An individual who is budget-conscious and wants to understand their grocery spending habits in detail. They are comfortable with technology and appreciate clear, actionable data visualizations. They are motivated to find savings and optimize their shopping.

##### Usability Goals
*   **Rapid Insight:** Users can identify their top 3 spending categories in under 60 seconds from launching the application.
*   **Effortless Navigation:** Users can drill down from the main dashboard to a specific product's history in no more than 3 clicks.
*   **High Learnability:** A new user can understand and use the application's core features without any tutorial or instructions.

##### Design Principles
1.  **Clarity First:** Prioritize clear, unambiguous data presentation. The meaning of every chart and number should be immediately obvious.
2.  **Insight over Information:** Don't just show data; provide insights. Visualizations should guide the user toward meaningful conclusions about their spending.
3.  **Seamless Drill-Down:** The transition from a high-level overview to granular detail should feel natural and instantaneous.
4.  **Material You:** Fully embrace the principles of Material Design, using its components and patterns to create a modern, trustworthy, and platform-native feel.

## 2. Information Architecture (IA)

    A[Main Dashboard] --> B{Category Selection}
    B --> C[Category Drill-Down View]
    C --> D{Product Selection}
    D --> E[Product Drill-Down View]
```

#### 2.2. Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:** The main entry point is the Dashboard, from which all other views are accessed via drill-down. No explicit global primary navigation bar is planned for the MVP.

**Secondary Navigation:** Contextual navigation elements (e.g., back buttons, filters within views) will facilitate movement within specific sections.

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** A clear breadcrumb trail will be implemented to show the user's current location and allow easy navigation back up the hierarchy (e.g., `Dashboard > [Category Name] > [Product Name]`).

## 3. User Flows

#### 3.1. View Overall Spending (Main Dashboard)

**User Goal:** To quickly see their overall grocery spending trends and top categories.

**Entry Points:** Application launch.

**Success Criteria:** User sees a graph of order totals over time and a ranked list of categories by spend.

##### Flow Diagram

    A[Launch App] --> B{Display Main Dashboard}
    B --> C[Show Order Totals Graph]
    B --> D[Show Ranked Category List]
    C & D --> E[User reviews overall spending]
```

##### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- If no data is available, display a clear message indicating no spending data and prompt for data import (future feature).
- If API calls fail, display a user-friendly error message and a retry option.

##### Notes:
This is the initial view of the application, designed for immediate insight.

#### 3.2. Drill Down into a Category

**User Goal:** To understand spending within a specific grocery category.

**Entry Points:** Selecting a category from the Main Dashboard.

**Success Criteria:** User sees a graph of spending for that category over time and a ranked list of products within it.
