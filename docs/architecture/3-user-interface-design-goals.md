# 3. User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The user experience should be clean, intuitive, and empowering. The primary goal is to provide users with maximum clarity on their spending with minimum effort. The interface will prioritize data visualization, presenting insights in a way that is easy to understand at a glance.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

*   **Drill-Down Navigation:** The core user journey will be a seamless drill-down from the main dashboard (high-level overview) into specific categories and then individual products (granular detail).
*   **Interactive Visualizations:** Users will interact primarily with charts and sorted lists to explore their data. Selections on these components will trigger navigation to more detailed views.

### Core Screens and Views

*   **Main Dashboard:** The central view showing order history and top spending categories.
*   **Category Drill-Down View:** A detailed view for a single category, showing its spending trend and a ranked list of products within it.
*   **Product Drill-Down View:** A read-only view showing the purchase history and cost trend for a single product.

### Accessibility

*   **Target:** WCAG 2.1 AA

### Branding

*   The application will adhere to a modern **Material Design** aesthetic, using standard components and design principles.

### Target Device and Platforms

*   **Platforms:** Cross-Platform (Web, Android, iOS)
*   The application will be built from a single codebase to target modern evergreen web browsers as well as the last two major OS versions for Android and iOS.
