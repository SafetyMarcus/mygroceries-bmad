# 1. Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   Develop a functional data visualization tool for personal grocery spending analysis.
*   Enable users to import their own data to identify key spending habits and categories.
*   Empower users with personalized financial insights through their own data.
*   Achieve rapid insight into top spending categories (less than 1 minute).
*   Ensure a quick and easy data import process (less than 5 minutes).

### Background Context

With the rising cost of living, individuals are finding it increasingly difficult to manage their grocery expenses. This is largely due to inconsistent and non-granular data from major retailers, which makes it challenging to track spending effectively. "My Groceries" aims to solve this by providing a local-first data visualization tool that empowers users to analyze their own spending data, identify savings opportunities, and gain control over their grocery budgets.
