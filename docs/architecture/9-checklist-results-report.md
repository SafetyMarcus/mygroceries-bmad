# 9. Checklist Results Report

### Executive Summary

*   **Overall PRD Completeness:** 90%
*   **MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right
*   **Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready
*   **Most Critical Gaps:** Minor, non-blocking gaps in non-functional requirements (e.g., security hardening, specific operational needs), which are acceptable for an initial MVP of this nature.

### Category Analysis Table

| Category | Status | Critical Issues |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context | PASS | None |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition | PASS | None |
| 3. User Experience Requirements | PASS | None |
| 4. Functional Requirements | PASS | None |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL| Security, compliance, and detailed reliability requirements are not explicitly defined. |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure | PASS | None |
| 7. Technical Guidance | PASS | None |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL| Operational requirements (monitoring, deployment specifics) are not explicitly defined. |
| 9. Clarity & Communication | PASS | None |

### Top Issues by Priority

*   **MEDIUM:** It would be beneficial to add placeholder sections for **Security** and **Reliability** in the Non-Functional Requirements to be addressed post-MVP.
*   **LOW:** Explicit **Operational Requirements** (like monitoring or specific deployment steps) can be deferred until the project moves towards a hosted or more widely distributed version.

### MVP Scope Assessment

The MVP scope is well-defined and appropriate. It focuses on the core user journey of data import and analysis, correctly deferring features like user accounts and in-app data editing.

### Technical Readiness

The PRD provides clear technical constraints and a solid architectural foundation. The identified risk of PostgreSQL setup complexity for end-users is noted correctly and is a key consideration for the architect.

### Recommendations

1.  **Proceed to Architecture:** The document is ready for an architect to begin designing the system.
2.  **Acknowledge NFR Gaps:** While not blockers for the MVP, the team should be aware of the non-functional requirements that will need to be specified in future releases (primarily around security and operations).

### Final Decision

*   **READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design.
