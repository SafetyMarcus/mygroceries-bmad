  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'The removal of fallback credentials in DatabaseFactory.kt eliminates the previous security concern. The application now explicitly requires database credentials via system properties.'

    notes: 'HikariCP used for connection pooling is a good practice.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Core database setup is well-covered by integration tests.'
