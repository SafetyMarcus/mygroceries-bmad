status_reason: 'The core database setup and migration functionality are implemented, but test coverage is insufficient, particularly for migration application and schema validation. Hardcoded database credentials also pose a security risk.'

top_issues:
  - id: 'TEST-001'
    severity: high
    finding: 'Lack of integration tests to verify schema creation and basic data persistence as per AC 5. The existing DatabaseFactoryTest is insufficient.'
    suggested_action: 'Implement integration tests that connect to a test PostgreSQL instance (e.g., using Testcontainers) and verify that Flyway migrations create the expected schema and that basic data operations work.'
    suggested_owner: 'dev'
  - id: 'SEC-001'
    severity: medium
    finding: 'Hardcoded PostgreSQL username and password in DatabaseFactory.kt.'
    suggested_action: 'Externalize database credentials using environment variables or a secure configuration management system.'
    suggested_owner: 'dev'
  - id: 'TEST-002'
    severity: medium
    finding: 'DatabaseFactoryTest.kt uses an in-memory H2 database, which does not accurately reflect the production PostgreSQL environment.'
    suggested_action: 'Update DatabaseFactoryTest.kt to use a test PostgreSQL instance (e.g., with Testcontainers) or add a separate integration test suite for PostgreSQL-specific behaviors.'
    suggested_owner: 'dev'
  - id: 'MNT-001'
    severity: low
    finding: 'Broad exception catching in createDatabaseIfNotExists() can mask other issues.'
    suggested_action: 'Refine exception handling to specifically catch "database already exists" errors and log other exceptions.'
