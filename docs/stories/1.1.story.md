# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Dependencies

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a properly configured Kotlin Multiplatform project structure,
**so that** I can efficiently build and share code between the server, web, Android, and iOS clients.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A new Kotlin Multiplatform project is created with a monorepo structure.
2.  The project includes modules for `shared`, `server`, `web`, `android`, and `ios`.
3.  Core dependencies are added and resolved: Ktor (server/client), Compose Multiplatform (UI), PostgreSQL driver (server), and Kotlinx Serialization (JSON).
4.  A basic health-check endpoint is functional on the Ktor server to verify the setup.
5.  The project can be successfully built for all target platforms (server, web, android, ios).

## Tasks / Subtasks

    - [ ] Configure `ios` module (AC: 2)
- [ ] Add and resolve core dependencies (AC: 3)
    - [ ] Ktor (server/client) [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md, architecture/5-components.md]
    - [ ] Compose Multiplatform (UI) [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md, architecture/5-components.md]
    - [ ] PostgreSQL driver (server) [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md, architecture/5-components.md]
    - [ ] Kotlinx Serialization (JSON) [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md, architecture/5-components.md]
- [ ] Implement basic health-check endpoint on Ktor server (AC: 4) [Source: architecture/6-rest-api-spec.md]
    - [ ] Add unit tests for health-check endpoint [Source: architecture/9-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
    - [ ] Add integration tests for health-check endpoint [Source: architecture/9-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- [ ] Verify project builds successfully for all target platforms (server, web, android, ios) (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- **Previous Story Insights**: N/A (first story)
- **Data Models**: N/A (this story focuses on scaffolding, not data models directly)
- **API Specifications**:
    - Health check endpoint: `GET /health` [Source: architecture/6-rest-api-spec.md]
- **Component Specifications**: N/A (this story focuses on scaffolding, not UI components directly)
- **File Locations**:
    - Monorepo structure with modules: `shared`, `server`, `web`, `android`, `ios` [Source: architecture/5-components.md]
- **Testing Requirements**:
    - Unit tests for business logic and ViewModel logic [Source: architecture/9-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
    - Integration tests for API endpoints [Source: architecture/9-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
    - Tools: Kotest for assertions, MockK for mocking [Source: architecture/9-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Technical Constraints**:
    - Language: Kotlin 1.9.23 [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
    - Core Framework: Kotlin Multiplatform 1.6.10 [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
    - UI Framework: Compose Multiplatform 1.6.1 [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
    - Backend Framework: Ktor 2.3.9 [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
    - Database: PostgreSQL 15.x [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
    - Database Driver: Exposed 0.49.0 [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
    - Serialization: Kotlinx Serialization 1.6.3 [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
    - `shared` module dependencies: Kotlinx Serialization, Ktor Client, Compose Multiplatform [Source: architecture/5-components.md]
    - `server` module dependencies: `shared` module, Ktor Server, Exposed (DB driver), PostgreSQL [Source: architecture/5-components.md]
    - Client modules (`web`, `android`, `ios`) dependencies: `shared` module, Compose for Multiplatform [Source: architecture/5-components.md]

### Testing
- **Test file location**: Within each module's `commonTest` or `test` source set.
- **Test standards**: All business logic in the `server` module and `ViewModel` logic in client modules must be covered by unit tests. All API endpoints defined in Epic 1 must have corresponding integration tests.
- **Testing frameworks and patterns to use**: Kotest for assertions, MockK for mocking dependencies. Integration tests will spin up an in-memory or Testcontainers instance of the Ktor application and make real HTTP requests.
- **Any specific testing requirements for this story**: Unit and integration tests for the health-check endpoint.
