# Story 1.4: Implement Product CRUD API

## Status
Reaady

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create API endpoints for managing `Product` data,
**so that** products can be created, retrieved, updated, and deleted from the database.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A `Product` data class is defined in the `shared` module. It must include a field for its associated `categoryId`.
2.  The Ktor server exposes RESTful endpoints at a `/products` path.
3.  The following endpoints are implemented:
    *   `POST /products`: Creates a new product.
    *   `GET /products`: Retrieves all products.
    *   `GET /products/{id}`: Retrieves a single product by its ID.
    *   `PUT /products/{id}`: Updates an existing product.
    *   `DELETE /products/{id}`: Deletes a product.
4.  Each endpoint correctly performs the corresponding Create, Read, Update, or Delete operation in the PostgreSQL database.
5.  Server-side validation is implemented:
    *   All product IDs must be handled as UUIDs.
    *   The `name` for a product cannot be empty.
    *   The `categoryId` provided when creating or updating a product must correspond to an existing category in the database.
6.  The functionality is covered by automated tests.
