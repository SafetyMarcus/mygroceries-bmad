# Story 2.1: Basic UI Shell and Navigation

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a basic application window with a clear title and structure,
**so that** I have a consistent and recognizable frame for all application content.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Main Application View**
   - [ ] Create a main application view using Compose for Multiplatform
   - [ ] Ensure the view serves as a container for all other UI content
   - [ ] Implement responsive layout that works on all target platforms (web, Android, iOS)

2. **Top App Bar**
   - [ ] Add a top app bar displaying "My Groceries" as the application title
   - [ ] Ensure the app bar follows Material Design 3 guidelines
   - [ ] Make the app bar responsive to different screen sizes

3. **Navigation Framework**
   - [ ] Set up a basic navigation structure using Compose Navigation
   - [ ] Create a navigation graph with a single destination for the dashboard
   - [ ] Implement a navigation controller to handle screen transitions

4. **Platform Consistency**
   - [ ] Verify UI renders correctly on all target platforms
   - [ ] Address any platform-specific UI/UX considerations
   - [ ] Ensure touch targets meet accessibility guidelines on all platforms

5. **Material Design Compliance**
   - [ ] Implement Material 3 theming
   - [ ] Use appropriate typography and spacing
   - [ ] Ensure proper elevation and shadow handling

## Technical Notes
- Use Compose Multiplatform's `MaterialTheme` for theming
- Implement platform-specific navigation components where needed
- Consider using `expect/actual` for any platform-specific UI requirements
- Follow Material Design 3 guidelines for components and layout

## Dependencies
- Compose Multiplatform
- Compose Navigation
- Material 3 for Compose

## Story Points: 3

## Priority: High

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk**: Platform-specific UI inconsistencies
  - **Mitigation**: Regular testing on all target platforms
- **Risk**: Navigation complexity across platforms
  - **Mitigation**: Keep navigation simple and test thoroughly

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code is reviewed and approved
- [ ] UI renders correctly on all target platforms
- [ ] Basic navigation is functional
- [ ] No new warnings or errors
- [ ] Documentation is updated
