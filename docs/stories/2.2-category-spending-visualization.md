# 2.2: Category Spending Visualization

**As a** user,
**I want** to see a visual representation of my spending by category,
**so that** I can quickly understand my spending distribution across different grocery categories.

## Status
Done

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A pie chart or donut chart is added to the dashboard below the order totals graph.
2. The chart displays each category as a segment sized proportionally to the total spending in that category.
3. Each segment is colored distinctly and includes:
   - Category name
   - Total amount spent
   - Percentage of total spending
4. The chart is interactive, allowing users to (nice to have):
   - Hover over/tap segments to see detailed information
   - Click on a segment to drill down into category details (preparation for Epic 3)
5. The chart includes a legend that maps colors to categories.
6. The chart is responsive and works well on all screen sizes and platforms.
7. A loading indicator is shown while the data is being fetched.
8. Error states are handled gracefully with user-friendly messages.
9. The visualization adheres to the app's Material Design theme.

## Technical Notes

- Optimize for performance with large datasets
- Include proper state management for loading/error states
- Follow the established theming and styling patterns
