# 2.2: Category Spending Visualization

**As a** user,
**I want** to see a visual representation of my spending by category,
**so that** I can quickly understand my spending distribution across different grocery categories.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A pie chart or donut chart is added to the dashboard below the order totals graph.
2. The chart displays each category as a segment sized proportionally to the total spending in that category.
3. Each segment is colored distinctly and includes:
   - Category name
   - Total amount spent
   - Percentage of total spending
4. The chart is interactive, allowing users to:
   - Hover over/tap segments to see detailed information
   - Click on a segment to drill down into category details (preparation for Epic 3)
5. The chart includes a legend that maps colors to categories.
6. The visualization updates automatically when new orders are added or modified.
7. The chart is responsive and works well on all screen sizes and platforms.
8. A loading indicator is shown while the data is being fetched.
9. Error states are handled gracefully with user-friendly messages.
10. The visualization adheres to the app's Material Design theme.

## Technical Notes

- Use a Compose Multiplatform-compatible charting library
- Ensure the chart is accessible (screen reader support, color contrast, etc.)
- Optimize for performance with large datasets
- Include proper state management for loading/error states
- Follow the established theming and styling patterns
